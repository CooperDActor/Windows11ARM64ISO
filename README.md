# Windows11ARM64ISO
This is an arm64 iso I believe this should be used for MAC VM's 
Some VM Software is 

UTM
and 
VMWARE FUSION

# UTM (hard but recommended as no licence needed)
with utm it is easy to make a vm but you would need to remove the cd/dvd (thats what its called) ISO file from the software

Mac (mac.getutm.app)

windows (N/A)


#VMWARE FUSION (easy but need a VMWARE account)

you need to sign up and go through millions of steps to get the DMG and licence just use UTM

Mac (vmware.com/products/fusion.html)

Windows (N/A)

to download the iso select releases and click on the iso and it is a 6GB file
